**Choubis** is an open-source AI Governance Plane designed to solve the "Liability Gap" in enterprise AI. While others build wrappers, we build the **Sovereign Control Plane** that ensures your AI agents are compliant, traceable, and secure 24/7.

## 🚀 Why Choubis?

In 2026, AI Technical Debt and Shadow AI are the biggest structural risks to enterprises. Choubis provides a three-pillar defense:

* **🛡️ Choubis Shield**: A high-performance Go-based MITM proxy that intercepts unmanaged LLM calls, redacts PII, and enforces corporate policy in <5ms.
* **📜 Choubis Ledger**: An immutable, cryptographic "Reasoning Trace" recorded to your Context Graph. Essential for agentic insurance and legal audit trails.
* **💓 Choubis Pulse**: Continuous adversarial stress testing using **AIPersonas** to simulate hostile regulatory audits before they happen.

## 📦 Quick Start

Run the sovereign bootstrap to get the Shield Engine live:

\`\`\`bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LOLA0786/Choubis/main/install.sh | sh
\`\`\`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Engine**: Golang (High-concurrency MITM Proxy)
- **Governance**: PrivateVault TEE Integration
- **Orchestration**: UAAL (Universal Agent Action Layer) Handshake
- **CLI**: Python Typer + Rich Terminal Interface

## 🇮🇳 Built for the Ground Market
Fully compliant with India's **DPDP Act** and global AI Safety standards.

### Sovereign AI Governance & Active Enforcement Plane
**Governance that doesn't just watch—it acts.**

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/LOLA0786/Choubis)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/LOLA0786/Choubis)

![DPDP-2026 Compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Compliance-DPDP_2026-green)

Choubis is the world's first open-source **Active Enforcement Plane** for AI. It solves the "Agentic Liability Gap" by sitting between your enterprise and any LLM provider, providing real-time PII redaction, cryptographic reasoning ledgers, and a **hardened Kill-Switch** for non-compliant intents.


## ⚡ Key Features
* **🛡️ Sovereign Shield**: Go-based MITM proxy with <5ms latency that redacts PII and bypasses provider-level WAF blocks.
* **📜 Reasoning Ledger**: Every agent action is cryptographically signed and assigned an **Insurance Score** for auditability.
* **🛑 Intelligent Kill-Switch**: Automatically terminates connections if the safety score drops below your enterprise threshold.
* **💓 Pulse Auditor**: Built-in adversarial simulation using **AIPersonas** to stress-test your AI guardrails 24/7.

## 📦 One-Click Bootstrap
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LOLA0786/Choubis.git
cd Choubis
make setup
make build
make run
```

## 🛠️ Ground-Market Architecture
Choubis is built to be "Simple yet Complicated."
- **Core Engine**: Golang (Optimized for high-concurrency).
- **Control Dashboard**: Python (Typer + Rich for high-fidelity monitoring).
- **Security Root**: PrivateVault & UAAL Handshake Protocol.

## 🇮🇳 Why "Choubis"?
"Choubis" (24) stands for **24/7 Sovereign Vigilance**. In the era of the **India DPDP Act**, manual audits are dead. You need an automated, always-on governance plane that scales with your agents.
